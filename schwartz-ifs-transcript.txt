okay so
welcome back to our third and final talk
today from
dr richard schwartz who's going to
present on internal family systems
okay so dr schwartz began his his career
as a systemic family therapist and an
academic
grounded in systems thinking dr schwartz
developed internal family systems in
response to clients descriptions
of various parts within themselves he
focused on the relationship among these
parts
and noticed that there were systemic
patterns to the way they were organized
across clients
he also found that when the client's
parts felt safe and were allowed to
relax
the clients would experience
spontaneously the qualities of
confidence
openness and compassion that dr schwartz
came to call the self
he found that when in that state of the
self clients would know how to heal
their parts
a featured speaker for national
professional organizations dr schwartz
has published many books
and over 50 articles about ifs you can
learn more about his work at
www.ifs.institute.com so
dr schwartz it's great to have you on
board for this this event and whenever
you're ready we'll just get started
thank you okay and thank you for
inviting me
now and uh yeah i'm happy to
follow uh two systems that i'm quite
familiar with
sc and and polyvagal
actually deb dana is a ifs therapist as
well
so i'm gonna
describe the history of the model in my
history
some and then describe the model and the
way we work with trauma
and then hopefully we'll do some
experiential exercises
and then we'll do the questions and
answers so
uh to jump in with this and i'm you know
just to explain the setting i'm in our
uh my family's vacation home
in michigan which is uh right on lake
michigan so it's
very lovely i thought i'd make you all
jealous a little bit
um so i'm sort of on vacation but i i'm
still very happy to
be with you so um
yeah i'm going to go back in time quite
a ways because i'm pretty old
so back to about 1982
and i just uh finished
a doctorate in maryland family therapy
because
i was one of those zella zealous
family therapists who thought we'd found
the holy grail
for psychotherapy and also thought that
people who
spent a lot of time mucking around in in
the internal world
namely particularly psychoanalysts
were wasting their time because we could
change all that by just reorganizing
the external system the family system
and sort of magically these symptoms
would disappear
and uh i was a structural
family therapist mainly a la
salvador minutian and mnuchin had
written
about the luck he'd had with anorexia so
i was eager to prove that it was also
equally effective with bulimia which
back in those days was somehow a new
syndrome
that had just emerged and i hooked up
with an eating disorder
treatment center or
support group and with a colleague mary
jo barrett
we we tracked down 30 bulimic kids and
their families
and and did this structural family
therapy
with them and i found that i could
reorganize the families just the way the
books said to do it
and still a bunch of my clients
didn't realize that they'd been cured
and they kept
they kept binging and purging and
so given my outcome study mindset it was
terribly frustrating for me
and uh so out of frustration i began
asking
why and they basically began
teaching this model to me because they
began talking about
what they called parts of them
and they would say something like when
something bad happens in my life
it triggers this critic who attacks me
calls me all kinds of names and then
that brings up another part
that makes me feel totally empty and
worthless and young and alone
and scared and that feeling is so
dreadful
that to the rescue comes the binge and
takes me away
takes me out of my body and i
at least temporarily feel better but
then the critic comes back and attacks
me
for the binge and the attack from the
critic the shaming
brings back that young empty alone
desperate part so the bench has to come
back
and as i listened to that
and because of my systems thinking from
family therapy
it sounded kind of familiar it sounded
like
these sequential interaction patterns
that i've been tracking in families and
intervening into
and so i became intrigued
and began
trying to get my clients to relate
differently
to these parts inside in some ways the
way i would try with
family members now at the time
i was assuming that for example the
critic
was a internalized critical voice
maybe from one of the parents and the
binge
was a out of control impulse i was
assuming that because that's basically
what most of the field thought about it
and still does really and
um when you think of these things
that way your options for having your
client relate to them are limited
because uh if it's just this
inner voice then i tried to get my
client
to stand up to it and don't just sit
there and take it which is what they
said they would do you know stand up for
yourself in there
and control the binge regulate yourself
don't let it take over that way and
so i would send clients home with that
homework
and then come back saying
you know it's making it worse i'm
binging more than ever
and uh and i
am harder on myself than ever
but i didn't know what else to do than
to say and stand up stronger and control
more
because of the way i was understanding
these things
and then the first client i was aware of
who had a big sex abuse history
and also cut herself on her wrists and
insisted on showing me the
open wounds every session
and and by then i learned about
the gestalt empty chair technique where
you
have a client imagine a part of them is
sitting in a chair across from them
and have a dialogue and then they can
actually move into that chair and and be
the
say the critic talking back to them
and so i was hearing about a lot of
parts so i'd have a lot of chairs and
i'd have
clients hopping all over my office and
it's fascinating to watch
because people can really get into these
different parts
and roles and uh
so i was trying to get my client to
stand up to that cutting part
and to you know discipline it and
so one session i decided i wasn't going
to let it out of my office without
uh it agreeing not to cut her that week
and after a couple hours of her
badgering it and me badgering it
it finally said okay i'm not going to do
it now this week
and of course i open the door the next
session and she has a big gash down the
side of her face
and i internally just collapsed when i
saw that
and spontaneously said i give up
i can't beat you with this and the part
said you know i don't want to beat you
and that was a turning point in the
history of this work because i
shifted out of that coercive controlling
mindset that part of me
to just being curious and i just again
spontaneously said well then
why do you cut and the part
talked about how when she was being
abused
as a child it had to get her out of her
body
and contain the rage that would get her
more abuse
and when i heard that i shifted again
now i'm not just curious but i have a
kind of compassion
for the uh for the
role it had to play and appreciation for
how heroic it had been in her life it
actually
had saved her life and
when i expressed that to the part
it broke into tears because everyone had
demonized it and tried to get rid of it
or at least
manage it controlled it and here finally
it was getting to tell its story
and so that made me start thinking maybe
these parts aren't what they see
maybe they are like children and
families
hence the name internal family systems
um who are
naturally valuable wonderful
but are forced out of their valuable
state
by traumas or attachment injuries or the
dynamics
in in the internal family or the
external family
and are in roles therefore that
they don't necessarily like but they
believe are necessary
to keep the system safe and that
actually is now almost
40 years later is that right oh my god
yeah
um and thousands of clients later
and now thousands of people using this
all over the world
it's safe to say that that is true that
uh
uh just to backtrack a little bit basic
assumption
is that everybody is a multiple
personality in the sense that everybody
has
parts that it's the nature of the mind
to be that way to be multiple
we're born like that that it's not
the product of trauma it's not
uh it's not a
pathological condition to have these sub
personalities it's just the nature of
the mind
and that we have them
because they help us in our life they
each contain
valuable resources and qualities that
can
make life a lot easier and help us
with our whatever our vision is for our
life
but that they are forced out of their
naturally valuable states
by trauma and they become frozen
in the traumatic time so that they don't
even know that you've grown up
if we do an exercise i don't want to
give away too much but
one of the questions i would have you
ask one of your parts is how old do you
think
i am not how old is the part but how old
does this part
think i am and i would say
70 of the time the number comes back in
single digits so they're frozen
back when you got hurt
they live as if the trauma is happening
now
it was happening then and they carry
what i'm going to call burdens which is
a really important concept
in this model and is different from a
lot of other models
because the mistake that much of
psychotherapy
and most of our culture has made
has been to assume that the part
is the burden it carries so
uh so again the critic is just
an internalization of some critical
voice some critical parental voice
or the rage is just a bundle of anger
that's out of control
or and so on and so on and what i found
was
that trauma has the effect
of injecting into your system extreme
beliefs and emotions
and those extreme belief emotions will
attach
to the parts almost like a virus like
the coronavirus
and drive
become a kind of internal operating
system drive the operation of the part
but isn't the part is an
external energy
or belief or emotion that came into you
and can be expelled and so
healing often is what we call
unburdening it's helping
parts come to trust that they don't have
to carry this stuff anymore
and they can you can ship it out of the
client system
so um yeah and again
the mistake the mistake of assuming the
part is the burden
then like i did in the beginning
your options for relating to it are
quite limited and you're going to have
your client
try to fight it or ignore it or
something like that
so um so that's parts
and as we
got to know that cutting part and
learned it also talked about
the parts it was still protecting that
were also frozen in those
trauma seeds and and uh
and we're we're hurting we're
carrying burdens like
total worthlessness and shame the the
part that i talked about earlier that
was so empty and
young and was one of those
and also carried burdens of loneliness
and worthlessness and
terror from being abused
so parts became clear
that some are protecting others and
again from my family
systems background and my systems
thinking
that was a lot of my focus wasn't just
on each part individually but how do
they relate as a system how do they
relate in ways that do resemble external
systems external families and that was
one of the big
ways initially it was very clear
that some parts protected others
and couldn't
unburdened couldn't transform
while they had to do this protective job
well the system was still
very very vulnerable okay so that's
parts and uh it's a challenge in this
field
to convince ev that there aren't any bad
ones i'm sort of the will rogers of the
phenomena i've never
met a part that ultimately i didn't like
and
we have worked with parts that have
murdered people
hearts that have have abused little kids
and so on and so on and even those parts
when approached from this mindfully open
curious place will reveal their secret
histories of how they were
forced into the roles they're in and and
talk about the burdens they carry that
drive them to
do these heinous things uh so
so that's parts and
once again everybody's got them
trauma makes them more extreme but
trauma doesn't produce them
they're not signs of pathology so that
people who are diagnosed
what used to be called multiple
personality disorders now
dissociative identity disorder are no
different
from you and i in having these full
inner personalities the difference
instead
is that unlike most of us
we didn't suffer as much chronic
horrible complex trauma that
blew their system more apart so that the
parts are
much more disconnected from each other
with these
these amnesic barriers among them and
so on but aside from that it's the same
phenomena
and again that's a pretty tough sell
both in psychotherapy and
in our culture and
then hard enough hard enough to believe
uh here's something else that's even
harder to believe and that is
that as i was doing this work with parts
and as a family therapist i would
have in families two people
in the family talking to each other and
would notice that when another chimed in
or jumped in the conversation
the two who initially were talking would
get more extreme with each other
and so as family therapists we learned
to try and improve the boundaries around
the two we were talking
by asking the third to just wait
and maybe even move out of line of
vision
uh move back in the room some more give
more space
and so as i was now i'm hip to the fact
that these parts aren't what they see
and that they actually deserve to be
listened to
and have better dialogues with each
other so i'm
maybe i'm trying to have my client talk
to that critic
and uh try to you know get to know it
better and and help it
not have to be so attacking all the time
and as i'm having that happen my clients
getting
furious with the critic and the critics
getting defensive and the whole thing is
is going south and
so i began asking clients is there a
part that jumped in that's making you so
furious with the critic
and could you get it to just step out or
just relax or just
open space and clients
to my amazement at the time and say okay
yeah i can do that
yeah it did now it's step back
and i would say now how do you feel
toward the critic
and i'd get an entirely different answer
and often in the direction of
i'm just kind of curious about why it
calls me names
seconds earlier they hated it or they
were terrified of it
but we get that to step back and
spontaneously without any cueing from me
clients would say something along the
lines of
i'm curious about it or even i feel
sorry for it that it has to do this job
inside of me
and that blew my mind because
i was working with a population where
they'd been abused so severely often
that
if you went by general developmental
psychology or attachment theory
there's no way that
that should be the case that they should
have those kinds of qualities of
curiosity
calm confidence was what i was seeing
come
forward relative to the parts
given their histories and yet there it
just by getting parched open little
space it was like this other person
would pop
out and knew how to relate to the parts
in a healing way
and could even take over the sessions
even in clients
who'd been abused on a daily basis so
they didn't get these qualities
from their caretakers in some critical
period in their childhood
so that was very very hard to believe
because as i would do this
process of getting parts to separate it
was like the same person would come out
and a lot of other clients
and uh and their parts would relate well
the critic would soften and would start
to tell its secret history of how it got
stuck in this role and my client would
increasingly have compassion
and so on and when i
asked my clients now tell me about that
part of you
because that's great let's keep that
around
they would say you know that isn't a
part like these others
that's more myself that's more
who i really am so i came to call that
the self of the capital s and now again
almost 40 years later and
thousands of people using this all over
the world
it's said we can safely say that that
self
is in everybody can't be damaged
and does know how to heal both in the
inner world
and in the outer world and that is the
big discovery of ifs
that uh that actually excuse me
changes everything because
and is just beneath the surface of these
parts such that when they do open
space it comes to the surface
so that is a totally different view
than most psychotherapies and then
our culture has about human nature
which generally has been there's this
this veneer of civilized
uh aspects of you and then trying to
contain
all these primitive impulses of who you
really are so
so um
anyway that was is the big deal about
ifs
and that that's in everybody and that
can be accessed quickly and that it
knows how to heal
so that even when we work with couples
or we work with families or now we're
working more with corporations and
larger groups before we do anything i'll
help
everybody access self and then
in that state talk to each other and
find that
we don't have to do much else than hold
people in that place
and they'll figure out how to improve
their relationships
and also it's really very very important
that i as the therapist
stay in that state myself and know when
i'm in it and know when parts have
jumped in and
triggered been triggered and taking over
and know how to get my parts to quickly
open space
when a client triggers me so that i can
come back to
so i can come back to the compassion
that i had seconds earlier
so and as i was seeing this happen in
lots of other clients
i began to catalog the qualities
that would emerge spontaneously and so
we have what we call
the eight c's of self-leadership because
oddly enough
all of them began with the letter c so
i've mentioned i think
four of the eight so far often the
foundational one the one that comes up
first is curiosity
so and then calm
and confidence and compassion
but then also um courage like the
courage
to go into these inner abysses or caves
or basements that
the client was really afraid to enter
before are
and um creativity much more
flexibility and creativity and how they
would relate to the parts and relate to
people in the outside world
or uh connectedness
a sense of being more connected to other
people
to your parts and a desire to connect as
and then clarity so initially a client
might see the critic
in their mind as a kind of monster
and then all the parts that were afraid
of it or hated it separate
and now it just looks like a uh a
teenage kid
who who's hurting and they they can
they have compassion for it so those are
what we call the eight c's
of self-leadership and again that's all
in everybody
uh and and we're blended to more or less
degrees with our parts so we
rarely experience all that most of the
time we experience our parts
burdens but as they open space more and
more we can be in that state
and so then the the final little
theoretical piece about ifs for now
is as i was exploring all this
i began to
have my clients work with their parts
but i was finding that there would be
these
very negative after effects to some of
my sessions
clients would have bad bad physical
pains maybe or fevers
or i had a client get into a car wreck
didn't see the car so
uh as i was seeing all this i thought oh
my god this is a far more delicate
ecology than i thought
i better be more careful and maybe even
not do this anymore
and then i got curious and i started
asking what am i doing wrong
and i learned i was doing a number of
things wrong
the main thing was i was bypassing
the parts that didn't want me to go to
these very vulnerable places
because clients would talk about their
parts and they would talk about
these inner children who were hurting so
badly and
wounded and you know that's a kind of
trope the wounded child
inside but but it was real i mean
clients would be talking about these
these young parts that were terrified or
hurting and so
it seemed natural to want to go there as
soon as possible and i would
and then we would have this big backlash
after uh doing that and again being a
systems thinking
thinker i started thinking okay it's a
delicate ecology what did i do wrong
so what i learned was after someone's
been traumatized
there is a common way they organize
and wow and so the parts
that get hurt the most by the trauma
generally
are these inner child parts that that
before they were hurt
are delightful and provide us
all kinds of wonderful emotions like joy
awe at the world and innocence and
and desire to be playful a desire to
connect with others and be creative
but once they get hurt there's a shift
and now they carry the burdens
of terror or fear or emotional pain
or betrayal or loneliness and all these
beliefs about you as as a as a person
now or
about how dangerous the world is all of
those burdens
now they they carry
and now they're not so much fun to be
around now we
don't want anything to do with them we
tend to to try to just move on
and by that meaning to exile
in our system those parts
so to lock them in interbasements or
abysses or
caves so we don't have to deal with them
anymore
and thinking that we are just moving on
that we're
uh we're letting go yeah we're
moving on from the memory sensations
emotions and beliefs
not realizing that we're actually
simply locking up inside our
most precious parts often we're losing
our juice
because we don't know that's what they
are we just think of them as memory
sensations
emotions and beliefs from the trauma and
when you get a lot of exiles
the world becomes much more dangerous
because so many things could trigger all
and you feel much more delicate and
because if an exile gets triggered it's
like a huge explosion
of of emotion
of of the uh trauma
the trauma emotions burdens
that can easily overwhelm you and bring
you right back into that scene and make
you feel as terrified or as
hurt or as young as as you felt then
and incapacitate you and
so many many trauma survivors walk this
tightrope uh of trying to be in the
world but also
constantly worrying about their exiles
exploding
out and overwhelming them and
so to manage all that
other parts are forced out of their
naturally extreme roles
and to get into the role of
trying to to manage the outside world
so that our exiles don't get triggered
and they will
they will try to manage your
relationships so
no one gets close enough to trigger your
exiles or
people you depend on don't get too
distant or
manage your appearance so that you never
get rejected
you look good and manage your
performance so that
uh you get a lot of accolades to counter
all the worthlessness these exiles feel
and so on and so on they're desperately
just trying to
contain all of this so we call those
the managers that's one set of protector
parts and uh
they try their best in traditional
psychotherapy they'd be called the
defenses
so and the world has a way of
penetrating the getting past those
triggering exiles so you have to have a
kind of backup system when that happens
and so there's another set of parts who
immediately goes into action after an
exile has been
triggered and is flooding you or is
threatening to do that
to take you away or to distract you
somehow until it burns itself out
or douse the flames
with some substance or somehow
manage this emergency that and
and these parts again because these are
like flames of exile emotion
we call firefighters they're really
trying to fight the flames
and in contrast to the managers
are often impulsive and reactive
and don't care about the
consequences don't care about the
collateral damage they do to your body
to your relationships they just think
they've got to get you out of those
feelings
as immediately and so with trauma
you know often it's uh parts that will
make you dissociate
or get enraged or take you
to some addiction or and so on and so on
and so most severe trauma survivors have
some of those
and those often uh get you in trouble in
the outside world and so
you have managers who are trying to
these these firefighters
because of that
and become very critical of you for
letting them take over even though the
firefighters are just desperately
trying to do the same job as the
managers which is to contain the exiles
so um and in general
you know there's a million manager
common manager jobs but
one of them they often are these inner
critics who are criticizing you
just to try and get you to behave
because they
are over promoted inner children
themselves
and like in family therapy we would call
them a parentified child a child who has
to take on a parental role
and none of these parts anymore
trust self they don't trust that you
can lead the system because you didn't
protect them from the trauma
and so they are like parentified inner
children who have to do all this they
so um so that's the
the map to the territory and it's useful
in the sense that what i learned was
not to go to exiles without the
permission of the protectors
because that was the mistake i was
making earlier when we would get the
backlash
uh i would bypass the protectors
and open the door of these exiles and my
in the session might do okay but then uh
there was this all these protectors felt
furious that they allowed that to happen
that she was so exposed to me and showed
all this vulnerability
and they'd sworn they never let that
happen again and
didn't we didn't do it with that with
permission and so i learned
now we always go to protectors first
almost always not expecting them to
change and this is another difference
from many other systems where
we're going to anorexic parts
saying we know you can't really stop
making her starve
until we heal this other stuff but would
you give us permission to go to this
other stuff
and in the meantime you can keep doing
what you do for a suicidal part it's the
same thing
which seems counterintuitive but if you
wrestle with them before you've healed
what they protect
they usually just get stronger so
so we go asking for permission
also honoring them for their protective
role
for even though it looks
self-destructive how we get that they're
really just trying to help
and and then
ask what they're afraid would happen if
they did let us open the door of those
exiles
and there are a lot of common fears
biggest one usually is being overwhelmed
by all the emotion that'll explode out
of there
and we have ways to to deal with that
it's not the same as
as in sc or a lot of other trauma
therapies
because we're not necessarily
watching for the window of tolerance and
doing grounding skills
for reasons i i don't have time to get
into right now
one of the reasons is we don't have to
because we learned years ago
that parts can contain themselves if
they
think it's in their best interest to not
overwhelm they won't and so we can
negotiate all that without having to do
all the other
kinds of things and also
that what i'm calling self has a massive
window of tolerance if you can get
a client in that state before they go to
their exiles
they can handle most any emotion so you
so it's just different it's different in
that way
so and we go then we get permission we
go over all the fears the protectors
have and they finally say okay you can
open the door
you know if it sounds to them like i
know what i'm doing
uh then they're eager they don't want
to stay in these roles they they want us
to be able to heal this
so you as soon as they get the sense
that we know
how to do it they tend to open the door
and so then i would have my client
who would then at that point be often
seeing themselves as a child
uh how do you feel toward that part and
get my client in a compassionate place
relative to the child
get connected to i get close to it in
this inner world
and ask what happened
ask for the child part to really share
in the sense of letting you feel see
and sense everything that the child went
through
during the trauma and
often that's quite emotional but again
i'm not worried about that window of
tolerance because
if i have enough self it's not going to
be a problem uh
and so we do that until the part the
exile feels fully witnessed
from a compassionate place like finally
you get what happened and how bad it was
at which point i would say now i want
to go into that scene and be with that
little girl and the way she needed
somebody at the time
and you wouldn't see yourself going in
because if you saw yourself that's
another part that's trying to help
you would just see the little girl you'd
be close to her you'd be holding her
maybe
and you would be maybe telling the
abuser to get the hell out of there
or going and talking to the parents
about how they shouldn't be
treating her this way so you would be
doing what she needed to do
back in the scene and then when that's
complete we have you take her to a safe
comfortable place
could be in the present could be a
fantasy place
at which point if the part trusts that
it can stay
it never has to go back and also that
you're going to follow through and take
care of her
and answering the question are you ready
to release unload
the extreme beliefs and emotions you got
from the these times
most parts will say yes and we just have
a kind of ritualized way for shipping
them out of the client system
what would you like to give it up to
light water fire
wind earth or anything else
and client pick one of those have the
light shine on it
tell it to let all that out of its body
until it's all gone out of the system
and then the part feels much lighter and
wants to go play
we invite qualities to come in that it
would like
the client can identify what's coming in
and that's a complete
healing of one part and then we'll bring
in all the others
to see they don't have to protect it
anymore and
uh and now ask what they'd like to do
because they're freed up they're
liberated they don't have to do these
jobs anymore
and help them into their new roles and
they may have to unburden also
so i sped through what often takes a
couple three hours to try and
make sure there's enough time for some
questions and answers
um and and to do an experiential piece
to this so i'm going to do the
experiential piece
after i pause here and just see
uh if there are questions and answers
uh now i assume that i i should look on
the chat over here or
uh whoops you're dr schwartz so um
okay you're ready you wanna do the q a
session night and then do the
experiential
session at the end yeah yeah and then i
think there'll probably be
time for a q a at the very end too okay
great so how long do you
want to do like 10 minutes 15 minutes
what would you prefer yeah 10 minutes
would be great
okay great just getting the questions up
here tonight
sorry two seconds we've got a problem
with the document here um
can you uh send us an email instead
no it's you need to actually send
another email because i don't have
access to the google doc
so just right here that's fine
sorry with this okay
so the first question is from alexandra
and alex asks are there times when it's
advisable to cultivate
or encourage an alter ego this seems to
be suggested as a coping mechanism for
performing arts
public speaking in sports does this
process of changing one's personality
mean that one is deliberately
encouraging sub-personality
to become dominant and does this get in
does this get in the way of healing
trauma
um yeah i don't know a lot about
uh systems that encourage that alter ego
thing but mainly what we're doing is
trying to
help these parts who as i said earlier
have felt like they've got to run the
show trust there's this self in there
who can who can be the leader so self
leadership is a big concept in ifs
and i work you know i work with athletes
and there are very athletic parts that
are very useful
in whatever they're doing but it's also
very helpful for those parts to allow
self to
to be there too so a lot of that's what
we negotiate
so there isn't the cultivating of an
alter ego like we don't cultivate
anything it's all in there
including self because there are you
know there are a lot of systems that
are spiritual systems that talk about
how you have to
you have to you know strengthen the
muscle of compassion
i don't find that to be the case at all
you have to release the compassion
that's already in you
so it's just a very different concept
than that
i can't hear you yeah
interesting the next question is from
christopher and he's asking
is there a rule for emdr in internal
family systems therapy
in terms of unburdening for patients who
have had an abusive experience during
your childhood
yeah there's a lot of people who combine
ifs and emdr
um and they'll you know they'll do this
at various
points but uh in in leading up to doing
this
they might check in with protectors be
sure the protectors are okay with it
they do this and that can sometimes
create a spontaneous unburdening
and then after they do this they'll
check in with all the parts to see how
they reacted to it
so my understanding and i'm very happy
to hear this
is that andrea which is the big emdr
organization
has advocated that people learn ifs
uh so that when they do the mdr it's
more ecologically sensitive
next one is from jan and he's asked
quite similar is your approach to voice
dialogue
yeah yeah um it's similar in the sense
and i you know i've had conversations
with hal stone who died this year
uh and uh it was a big loss um
so he was a pioneer in the idea
that parts or what he called voices
are uh what i described are
sub-personalities who have value he was
a
neo-yongian and uh took young's idea of
complexes
and called them voices and would have
uh people what the therapist would then
do the interviewing with the parts
directly which is a bit different
although we do some of that
one of the big shifts was
having the self be the one who talks to
the parts and tells me what's happening
in the inner world
and we do that because of this there are
three main goals to artifacts
the first is as i was describing to
release these parts
from the extreme roles they've been
forced into so they can be who they're
designed to be
the second is what i'm going to call the
um
the reinstating of trust the
getting the parts to come to trust the
self as a leader
inside and then the third is a
re-harmonizing
of this inner system uh so that the
parts not only are out of their
extreme roles but they're getting to
know each other and they're they're
liking each other working together
and there's actually a fourth which is
to then have self become
the leader in the outside world too so
going back to the second of those goals
one of the reasons we sort of prefer
having the client self do the
interactions with the parts
is that foster's attachment to
this is like attachment theory taken
inside in that sense
the parts come to see the self as the
good attachment figure
rather than the therapist and if you're
the one interviewing the parts then they
start to
attach to you and transfer to you and
all that
so anyway that's fascinating um okay so
the next one is from carl and carl asks
how does the clinician get the client to
differentiate
or segregate the different parts from
the whole self
yeah so if i was working with you you
came in and you
tell me you've got a problem i would say
okay when this problem happens
what do you say to yourself or what do
you feel inside
and you would say i yell at myself or i
i feel totally hopeless or i feel
and as you were saying that i would
feedback
because we all as therapists learn to do
that to feedback
what you were saying in reflective
listening
but adding the phrase so one part of you
feels
ba and another part of you feels that
and another part of you feels this and
then another one says this to you
is that right and you would say yeah
that's right
because everybody uses the word parts at
least in the u.s
so it's not if i'd said one of your sub
personalities feels this way or another
of your ego states or so that's part of
the reason i use the word part because
it's common parlance it doesn't threaten
anybody
and so people say yeah okay that's right
and i would say okay we've identified
five
parts of you that are stuck to this
problem
is there ones you want to change or get
to know
or have some help with and you might
pick one
and now if the if i thought the one you
picked was an exile
like you might say i wanna you know i
wanna not
feel this worthlessness in my gut
i'd say we'll get to that but first i
wanna
work with whatever parts of you are
afraid to let us anywhere near that
so then we would work with the
protectors that don't want you to reveal
that exile uh so anyway that's
you know a nutshell how we get started
okay so um alexandra has asked what
about the idea
that people with more trauma might have
greater numbers of distinguishable parts
israel
have any thoughts on that yeah i mean
it's true
but not because they have more parts
it's because
more they have more burden parts and
when a part gets burdened it stands out
in boulder relief
so it's much easier to identify
but we all i don't know i don't know how
many parts people have
uh or if there's even a finite number
but we all have parts and
and some of them you have to be a subtle
parts detector to find because
they're close to you they're doing their
their valuable thing they're not
in the way at all so yeah okay great
um so that's pretty much the questions
we've had we've
been asked up until this point dr
schwartz um so maybe not be a good time
to go into
expert expert experiential exercises and
then
after we finish that we can do like a
little break and then a final q a
session at the end if that's
that sounds okay sure sounds good
okay great so
uh if you want to give this a try and
it's really really hard
to understand ifs until you actually
have tried it inside so
i do encourage you to give it a shot uh
you may not get real far with it but
we'll just see and to start
you know maybe as i was talking about
common parts you might be thinking about
some of yours
so i'd like you to pick a part
that you think is a protector
and most everybody's got a critic so
that might be a popular one to start
with
but other common protector roles
many people especially therapists have a
caretaker part
that tries to take care of everybody
else and doesn't let them take care of
themselves for example
many people have a dissociating part
that takes them a little bit out of
their body
so that they don't feel as much and
don't get hurt like that
uh and so on and so on so
just try to pick a part of you
that isn't one of these very very
vulnerable ones
i call exiles and
can get extreme sometimes and maybe get
in your way a little bit
so i'll give you a second to think about
and now if you have a part in mind
i would have you just focus on it
so if it's critic focus on that critical
voice or however you experience it or
with some kind of emotion focus on that
emotion or
just focus on it and then
see if you can find where it seems to be
located
in your body or around your body or
broadcasting from
just see if you can get some kind of
bodily sense of it wherever it seems to
be
primarily located and if you can't find
it
that's okay just focus on however you do
experience it
and then as you
focus on it i'm going to ask what might
seem like a
strange question but how do you feel
toward this part of you
in other words do you hate it
or are you afraid of it or depend on it
or want to get rid of it or
so on so
just notice how you're feeling toward it
as you notice it
and if you're feeling anything
that it's blocking just being curious
just being open to it and see if the
parts that are giving you these other
feelings would be willing just for a
minute or two
to separate and let you be curious let
you open your mind to it
in a new way and just see if that's
possible
just see if they'll let you become
mindful toward it
and if they're willing then you'll start
to feel open-minded
but if they're not willing don't force
you can just get to know what they're
afraid of if they would open
let you open to it you can spend the
whole time just doing that
yeah so
if you can get to that curious place
then go ahead and direct a question to
this place
that place in your body and just ask
what this part of you wants you to know
what does it want you to know about
itself and don't think of the answer
just wait for an answer to come from
that place in your body
what does this part want you to know
very open-ended
and a follow-up question would be what's
it afraid would happen
if it didn't do this job
what's it afraid would happen if it
didn't protect you this way
and if you've got an answer to that
question you learn something about
how it's protecting you and see if
it's possible to even extend some
appreciation to it
for at least trying to keep you safe
even if it's getting in your way in your
just see if you can let it know you get
that it's trying to
protect you and see how it reacts
see how it reacts to that appreciation
and then ask this protective part
if you could heal or change
what it's trying to protect inside
so it was freed up it didn't have to do
this job anymore
what might it like to do instead
i'll repeat that if you could heal
or change what it protects
so its services weren't needed in this
way anymore
what might it like to do instead and
again just wait for an answer don't
and then another question for this part
how old does it think you are
and just wait for that answer how old is
this part think you are
if the answer came that if the answer
that came was
younger or different than your actual
age
then go ahead and let this part know how
old you actually are and see how it
reacts
and then the last question for this
protective part of you
is what does it need from you
going forward in your life
what does it need from you in terms of
how you can
relate to it differently in the future
okay then when the time feels right go
ahead and thank the part
for whatever it shared with you
and let it know this isn't your last
meeting with it you're gonna
try to follow up and keep getting to
know it better and
and maybe release it from this role and
you also get
that that's not gonna be real possible
until you heal
what it's protecting but in the meantime
you get that it's very well intentioned
when all that feels complete then go
ahead and
shift your focus back outside
and take some deep breaths if that would
that took maybe seven or eight minutes
and i can see from the chat that some of
you had a powerful experience
um so
if if it's possible
i would love it if if a few of you would
just
write a little bit about what you
learned and what you did
and uh
yeah just anybody willing to do that
so we could read it
i see a question about can i give the
order of the questions i'd be happy to
go over that
while we're waiting uh
let me okay liz i see or do you want to
do you want to do this now
read some of these
i think there was one of the first liz
says uh
my critic always fearful and harsh
is really loving and trying to help me
be my best self and be content what do
you think about that
that's right beautiful catherine says
that she found it really freeing she
says thank you i'll learn that the hard
working slash overworking
part of me keeps me from feeling unseen
and invisible
well amina says my protector part was
resentful
sarah i spoke to my strong part she's
trying to protect me from all the
emotions i have
from when i was abandoned as a child of
five she wants to
protect it herself beautiful
claire my inner critic longs to be able
to hold my hand and take part in
take part in adventures with me instead
of working so hard to keep me out of
trouble
right i experience
the part deflecting my focus on myself
and moving it to others
protecting a seven-year-old maria my
protector thinks i'm
it she's upset and would like me to
listen to her and
grew up we're getting loads here uh
one from tracy i experienced control it
seemed to have protected me
but not allowed me to structure my
structure my business self um
julie says the symbol of protector was
fixing a baby on a changing mat
then was closing a door to my view
um jh caretaker feel it in the neck and
shoulders
afraid of not belonging age 5
if it could do something else it would
play and it would like to relax
charlotte's protector is a sense of
humor it's uncomfortable with
out and empty
kelly kelly says she's crying and that
was incredibly powerful
she spoke with her critic who told me
that she's trying to protect me from
failure
um they think i'm 18.
um we could we could literally go on
here for
maybe 15 minutes dr schwartz so i i do
you want to
what would you like to do from this
point on yeah i think i think that's
enough on
uh it's amazing uh
audience you have so i'm very grateful
for all the sharing and
for you know trying this out and
uh you know as i said that might have
been seven minutes
and in that period of time a lot of
maybe have made a permanent shift in the
way they relate to some of their parts
so
it's a taste of how powerful ifs can be
and i really appreciate the uh
people trying it out uh
so you know i had you go to a protector
and as i read the chats a number of you
found
younger parts too that we call exiles
and generally
in a time like this we discourage
doing much with the exiles other than
acknowledging them
and then finding a therapist to try and
help you with them
but some people can do it but just
because there are others whose parts
will backlash
if they try um we tend to discourage
without somebody and maybe many of you
have a therapist you can go to
to try and complete this work for
but it's it's really for me important to
let these protectors know again not only
are you
no longer 18 and you have a lot more
resources than used to
all of that but also let them know
that you you get it's going to be very
hard for them to change
until you heal what they protected so
uh you so this gives you you know i
talked about the eight c's
of self-leadership but we also have what
we all
what we call the five p's because i like
alliteration
uh and patience is one of those so this
this helps you
have patience with the pace of your
parts changing
when you know that they can't do it
until they're not having to protect
often sometimes they can't uh the other
if you're interested the other four p's
include
persistence and that combination of
patient persistence is very powerful
and perspective which is really the ifs
perspective
these aren't pathological symptoms these
are
just great parts stuck in hard roles
and then um
oh presence which is self
and then uh
playfulness and uh
anyway so yeah i really appreciate
trying this out and we
we do have some time left so
maybe we can go ahead and see if there
are more questions about the whole
shebang
we've got quite a few questions so we
could just get started with that and
we've got
five minutes left all right um i want to
say thank you very much dr schwartz that
was an excellent presentation
the feedback on the chat here has been
incredible you've really moved a lot of
people so
thank you very much yeah i know it was
it was really enjoyable
and uh again i very
impressed with how people tried it out
so i appreciate it
okay so um the first question here from
joyce
is it possible that the managers leaders
and firefighters for example
can exist unknowingly between siblings
as well as within
individuals so can this actually happen
within within a family
yeah well i mean uh most of the time
i mean you could look at a family
through this lens and you can see who
are the exiles and who are the managers
who are the firefighters in the family
you can do the same thing with companies
and with countries
i wrote a chapter
the book for therapists is called
internal family systems therapy
second edition which just came out this
year through guilford press if people
are interested
and in it i wrote a chapter where i i
looked at the united states
as a trauma survivor and how many exiles
that exist in the united states because
i think it's like 60 percent of the
population
lives paycheck to paycheck for example
and racism and all that stuff creates
all kinds of exile
and in any system that has a lot of
exiles including a country
you can have very extreme protectors and
the protectors are going to polarize
with each other
and that's the state we're in it's like
a trauma survivor
there's no self to be found in our in
our country now
uh so anyway i'm getting out on the side
but yeah
very interesting okay so donna has asked
what can you do when you intuitively
feel that parts of your stuck in the
manager mode
because that can prevent you from
forming new relationships and developing
serious trust issues yeah so you would
want to do a version of what we just did
just to get to know get curious
about the manager what it's afraid would
happen if it lets you form a
relationship
and in learning about that you'll likely
learn about some exiles and then you've
got to
go and and heal the exile and then
once you're able to heal the little girl
i think it was donna you say
uh then relationships aren't going to be
as threatening
and so this part isn't going to have to
always push people away when they get
too close
and but you can't do that until you've
actually healed the parts
that have been hurt by relationships in
the past and
and and the protectors are you know they
have good reason
to not want that to ever happen again
okay so lucy has asked what kind of
proactive behavior
would a manager typically undertake is
it usually healthy
or unhealthy coping coping strategies
well it varies a lot uh you know the
clients i work with
come to me because the managers are in
unhealthy
coping strategies so uh but there are
lots of managers that
that are doing healthy things um
but they're not burdened and they're not
in these protective roles they're just
trying to help you figure things out in
life and
give you advice and remind you you're
supposed to be doing things so i've got
a bunch of those
circling around all the time and then
there are managers
who because they don't trust anybody or
they see the world is very dangerous
or you know on and on they carry these
these burdens beliefs do get in your way
in a big way
and they don't know that you're old
enough to handle the world
and they think so those become the
unhealthy coping strategies
and unhealthy isn't even a the right
word because they were necessary
those strategies when you were young
they might even have saved your life
they're anachronistic if you know what i
mean by that they're
they're they were necessary at one time
they're not necessary now
but your parts don't know that because
they still think you're seven years old
so fascinating okay so
maram has asked how should the
relationship between the self
and the inner child continue going
forward after that compassionate contact
has taken place
yeah so that's a really good and
important question and one of the things
i like
best about ifs is that
uh people can do it on their own a lot
of the time
and a lot of the homework i give after a
session is
almost as a meditation every day
uh just find the part that we worked
with today
and just keep the dialogue going and
make sure
the part's still doing okay and just
keep reminding it that you're there
because so often people leave a session
and they just forget what we did and
they just go about their day
because their managers take over so it's
it's um
this is a empowering process
when people take it seriously it becomes
a life practice
more than a therapy so they're doing
some work i do some version of it every
day
and uh and then people at the end of
will say to me you know you're a pretty
good therapist but i healed myself
and that's really what we're shooting
for that's exactly what you want because
now they leave their
they leave therapy and they know how to
work with their parts
so fantastic um so bash has asked what
is a good way to begin to approach a
very anxious
and fearful part yeah
again i didn't go through all the steps
but
that first question of how do you feel
toward this anxious part is crucial
so i don't let anybody go to any part
until they say minimally i'd like to get
to know it
or even i care about i want to help it
and that that's some of the technique is
getting the other parts to open space
enough
that you can be in that open place so
once you're in that open
place then you just begin to ask it
why are you so anxious what are you
afraid would happen if you didn't make
me anxious
those similar questions that i had in
the exercise
and then you'll start getting answers
you didn't know about and then you start
to
to get see if you can get closer to it
you might embrace it
and comfort it uh letting it know it's
not alone anymore
because it's probably stuck in some
place where you were
very alone and very scared and nobody
was there and
now you're there with it so
great so you mentioned this is something
that you practice almost every day dr
schwartz
um for anybody listening to this now
that wants to develop
an ongoing practice of ifs with
themselves going forward or any like
practical recommendations that you would
give like before bed every night like
how would you
advise clients different people do it
differently uh
a lot of people journal a lot uh you
know it just depends on how you
doing her work we're we're trying to put
together an app
uh for this that makes it will make it a
lot easier
but uh there's a book on our website i
can't remember the name of it but it
gives a lot of
uh different ways that different people
do this on their own
um i think it's daily parts meditations
or something like that
and i yeah you said the website earlier
so yeah okay
cool um alexander has asked for someone
who constantly ruminates on trauma
and what one has done wrong what is
likely to be going on with parts in that
situation yeah so
um so there is this kind of
critic that's constantly telling you
what you did wrong
and blaming you for the trauma and
that's triggering an exile who believes
the critic and thinks you are
the culprit you you are bad so shame is
usually a three-part phenomena
you've got the exile who believes you're
worthless
then you've got the critic who tells you
it was your fault that you're bad
and then you got the firefighter who's
trying to get you away from all that
and the firefighters activity though
brings on more shame
from the outside people who see the
firefighter activity and
and so then the critic comes in stronger
and all that shame goes right into the
heart of the exile so there's more need
for the firefighter
so that's the that's sort of the trap
that most addicts are in they're in that
spiral
uh and so when we're working with that
we'll go i'll go usually to the critic
first
and just like many people in the chat
did they i'll learn
that it's not what you thought it's just
control your behavior so you don't get
shamed by people all the time
but and it doesn't realize that it's
efforts to do that are backfiring
and and we'll just negotiate a lot with
it and then we'll go to the firefighter
that's bringing you to the addictive
behavior
and get to know ed and negotiate it
with that permission to go to the exile
heal the exile and now these guys get to
get along with each other and they get
new roles so
it's a very different approach to
addiction for example
that way interesting okay so
elsa has asked how do you work out which
part is a protector
versus which part is an exile
well the good news is you don't have to
figure it out one of that's one of the
things i like best about ifs
is you don't have to be very clever as a
therapist because
you just ask so if i'm working with
anxiety for example somebody mentioned
earlier
going in i don't really know if it's an
exile because a lot of exiles carry
anxiety
but a lot of protectors do too and
they'll use the anxiety to control you
so as i'm getting to know the part i
might
have the client ask at some point
ask this anxiety if it's protecting
somebody else
if it's not protecting somebody else
it's probably an exile
if it is protecting somebody else it's a
protector
so um the answer my standard answer to
so many of those kind of questions
is just ask i have no idea which it is
but you can find out by just asking
um are you familiar with uh kristen
neff's work on self-compassion i'd be
curious to ask
how does this link with ifs and what are
your thoughts there
yeah i'm very familiar kristen actually
likes ifs a lot and i've collaborated
with her collaborator
chris germer we've done workshops
together and so on
and uh so it it complements
self-compassion training very nicely
and it's a little more specific because
instead of extending compassion to
yourself
in general you're extending compassion
to all these different very specific
and even to parts that that you
have hated all your life and so
it's it's yeah but it's in the same
ballpark
okay um we've got one here
in ifs therapy is it essential to relive
the trauma
well relive is uh an interesting
question so
my first answer is no that we don't
relive the trauma
um what we do is
i would get you in self so you felt
sorry for the part that carried the
and then i would have you witness what
happened
and how bad it was uh from this place of
and you might look like you're reliving
the trauma at that point
uh you might be crying wildly or
flailing or
but if i were to say uh
how how do you feel toward this part in
the middle of all that
you'd say i feel so sorry for him
so there's still a self that's still
there witnessing
rather than reliving you follow this
so this is in contrast
to some other trauma models which are
very much
catharsis based they're very much the
full expression of reliving
of the trauma
is the healing this is witnessing based
this is getting into self and really
getting what happened and how bad it was
and so some people as i said look like
they're reliving it even though itself
is still there
other people they're just sitting there
inside they're feeling a lot and there's
they're seeing a lot
but it's just they just look very calm
so it varies different people do the
witnessing
differently so
okay um we've got one here from uh
well the question is how do you deal
with a few parts jostling for attention
while you're trying to talk to one part
or rather there's a part trying to solve
problems and understand various parts
could you read that again so how do you
deal with a few parts
jostling for attention while you're
trying to talk to one part
yeah so again it's very similar when
you're working with a family
and everybody wants to chime in
everybody wants you to listen to them
and you say you're gonna i'm gonna
listen to you
but i'm gonna listen to this one first
so while i'm listening to this one
i want you to just relax i promise you
we're coming to you
and it works people are able to do that
it's just the same as an external family
brilliant
um have you got any advice for someone
who wants to bring
more self energy into their life and
live their life from that place
more often and more regularly
yeah well that's a lot of like i said
that's the fourth goal
of ifs and so the advice is to
find whatever parts are blocking that
and then do this process with them and
i should mention before we stop that
there's quite an ifs community in the uk
and i think their website even might be
ifs uk something like that
so there are a lot of ifs therapists
i think most more in england than
ireland but
you know we go to their website
fantastic we'll link to that in the
resources after after this
interview or this session as well um
alexandra was asked what about the role
of neuroplasticity and the apparent need
to practice
feeling or being certain ways if ifs is
so powerful at digesting trauma
that it happens instantaneously when we
figure it out so that's not
certainly worded but do you get the gist
of the question
i think so um i think what she's asking
is what about
this idea that for change to last you
have to create these new neural pathways
and that can take weeks and weeks
and i just don't find that to be the
case so
um we can in one session often
fully unburdened apart it totally
changes
uh the whole behavior internal
and i assume brain uh stuff
and there is um quite
blocking on his name but uh
there's a guy that has an approach
that's similar to ifs
and in his book he had a great write-up
about
how uh there is a hole over the branch
of neuropsychiatry that can
can substantiate that very quick change
of the brain
very interesting sorry i can't pull it
up right now
no problem um so we'll take a final
question here it is
how do you deal with trauma flashbacks
that keep coming up
in response to your curiosity and
exploration
yeah so flashbacks are usually
exiles that are lobbying these little
memory grenades out
saying we're in here deal with us
and they do it because they can't get
through otherwise
so i would say to you let those parts
know we're coming to them and we'll get
there quicker if they quit
doing the flashback thing and people's
flashbacks go away when they really
believe that
brilliant okay well dr schwartz that's
all the questions we've had
um i want to say thank you so much again
for
for taking the time to share your
knowledge and wisdom with us today
it's been it's been really enlightening
um going forward uh
any any advice for people any uh website
to check out have you guys got any
training coming up that you'd like
people to
check out as well yeah
um we're we run trainings
that you know as i say there are
trainings being run by this group in the
uk
and then i think they've shifted online
we run a lot of
online trainings now too what's happened
in the last i'd say
three four years is popularity of ifs
has exploded so it's
very very hard to get into a training
now so
people have to get on waiting lists and
then watch when they open it up and
everything
we're desperately trying to expand as
quickly as we can
but i you know that's uh
yeah that's what i would say about it
there are um
lots of courses and workshops that
people are offering all over the world
those are easier much easier to get into
and we have
we actually have an online ongoing
program
called the online circle that people can
find on the website
that is a year's subscription program
and gives a lot of the basics so i could
recommend that
and then lots and lots of books uh which
are in the store on our website
awesome we'll link to that in the
resources for the for the session as
well so
dr schwartz thank you so much again i
really appreciate it thank you to
everybody for tuning in today and
spending your time learning learning
from our speakers i really appreciate it
and yeah i guess just enjoy the rest of
your weekend
